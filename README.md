# Backend-Services
Welcome to Backend-Services repo!

This repo contains my backend learnigns, experiences, and projects.

## Why this repo?
- To be curious and consistent.
- To gain more clearity on why this instead of this.
- To write clean, readable, reusable, maintainable and scalable code.
- To learn new concepts, solve problems, and gain practical experience in areas I haven't touched yet, ensuring I'm ready for upcoming challenges.

Note: I have a similar repository dedicated to [frontend components](https://github.com/SushilGitt/frontend-components).
      Backend deployed on render it may take 30-60 seconds to load!
